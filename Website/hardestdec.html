            This page details the hardest decisions we had to make throughout the project. While there were some problems that we expected would give us some trouble at various points in the project, a few other problems also arose when we were working on the project. These problems were more unexpected, but we were able to solve them to the best of our ability. Overall, the entire project was challenging, but we were able to make justified decisions.

        <h2 class="small-heading">Coding experience</h2>
        <p>
            When we first learned that our task was to redesign a site for a university, using HTML, CSS, or even JavaScript to create a completely coded homepage, we felt a bit overwhelmed because none of us had experience or were familiar with coding. Before this class, we had never tried front-end coding before, and so we were unsure that we would be able to create a professional-looking or elaborate website, similar to other university websites. None of us were familiar with JavaScript, so we ended up using mostly HTML and CSS to code our redesign. We also used GitHub so that the three of us could work on the project at the same time, but we encountered many problems there. Many times when we would all code and sync at the same time, parts of files would be deleted or overwritten. However, we found a solution to both these problems by creating a simple and clean website and working on different parts of the site, so as not to create conflicts between code.

        <h2 class="small-heading">Navigational elements</h2>
        <p>
            The hardest decision we had to make was deciding which navigational elements we wanted to include in the user pathways, navigation bar, and footer. We relied heavily on the competitive analysis to decide which links and sections were most appropriate to include in each section. To begin the competitive analysis, we chose five reputable websites of types varying from private universities to universities in the UC system to state universities. Before we started analyzing, we looked through the site to get a general understanding of a conventional university website. We were very surprised by the vast amount of links that some of the universities had for some sections. In fact, there were just as many links on those sites as there are on GSU's current site, although these links were organized better than GSU's. We wanted to avoid this clutter and decided to keep a minimalist method in mind. As we identified the most popular elements using tallies, we found that some links that seemed inherent to the section were not always the most commonly used ones. While we tried to stick to making choices based on the tally count, we sometimes included links that we felt were important to the section but were only included on one or two of the five university sites we were analyzing. Additionally, there were some specialized links on GSU, such as their section on rankings, that we felt should be included on the site, although other universities did not place as much importance on them.

        <h2 class="small-heading">Homepage layout</h2>
        <p>
            We spent the most time creating the homepage of our redesigned site and had a difficult time deciding what kind of layout we should use. We were at a loss when it came to complex graphics and animations, so we decided on a clean layout. We wanted to keep most of the same information on GSU's current homepage, but without all the clutter and disorganization. Instead of keeping their three homepages, we encompassed their concepts all into one slider, which linked to the appropriate page of the site. It seemed redundant to have separate pages on the "Admissions & Campus Life" and "Schools & Colleges" when these were already included on separate parts of the site. We also wanted to better organize the "News", "Events", and "University Community" sidebar that was present on the current site, and so we created three separate headings underneath the main slider, that would lead to other pages about these ideas. We moved the ranking to the "About" page of the site because it didn't seem important enough to be on the front page. We decided to keep it, however, because it seemed that GSU might have thought it important, and that was why they included it on the frontpage.
