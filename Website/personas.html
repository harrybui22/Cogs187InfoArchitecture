                Matt has just finished taking his SAT’s and ACT’s and is looking for potential colleges he could attend, specifically specialized for biology majors. He has a special interest in science, and biology has been his favorite subject since elementary school. Although he doesn’t feel too confident with the outcome of his SAT scores, he knows he did pretty well on his ACT’s and if anything, his outstanding GPA will stand out among colleges. He also participates in a few extracurricular activities, including the soccer team as well as volunteering at a homeless shelter on weekends in Los Ageles. Although he can come off shy when meeting new people, he loves hanging out with his friends and eating out.

                Helen has just finished her second quarter of her first year at GSU. However after taking some classes as an econ major, she is strongly considering changing her major to something more in her interest. Although she liked economics, she only chose econ because she figured there would be more jobs available for an econ major than just a math major but found econ to be terribly boring. The only fun she had in her econ classes was the math part. She is now thinking of a math degree since she has always liked math. She isn’t sure how difficult college math will be but she knows she excelled in her high school math classes, getting a 5 in her AP Calculus exam. She is glad she realized this earlier on than later and wants to look into the different math programs GSU has to offer.
