            This page details the process and result of our competitive analysis. We chose the five schools listed below to discover what the standards used for university websites are. We focused on identifying the navigation elements that were used on each site, to give us an idea of what was or was not important to include in our redesign. By conducting this analysis, we were able to better understand how to begin our redesign.

            We began by first examining the navigation elements used on the above five websites. Upon closer inspection, we discovered that the majority of these sites used two different navigation bars and a navigation bar located in the footer. The first navigation bar was located at the very top of the page, and the second was placed anywhere near the top of the page to the middle of the page. 
        </p>

        <!-- User pathways description -->
        <p>
            The topmost navigation bar (called "user pathways" henceforth) almost always targeted user groups who might visit the site for their own reasons. These user groups typically included students, faculty, employees, alumni, families of students, and visitors to the site.

        <!-- Navigation bar description -->
        <p>
            The second navigation bar was more true to its name; the various links included on these navigation bars were mostly for directing users around the site. This navigation bar varied a little more differently from page to page, as different univeresities focused on unique areas and therefore provided specialized navigation bars.

        <!-- Footer description -->
        <p>
            The footers of each university website differed the most from one another. Some universities inclued a way to connect through social media, and other schools included more links to various parts of the site. Some of the footers contained a few simple links while other footers contained a multitude of links listed under a specific category.

        <!-- Final decision description -->
        <p>
            After identifying the most commonly used elements in each of these three navigation bars, we began to decide what to include in the redesigned GSU site navigation bars. We took into consideration both the popular links that were used on many other university websites and the focuses that GSU seemed to have.
        </p>
        <p>
            After careful consideration, we decided that we would stick to the evidently conventional three-navigation-bar layout. We chose to include "Students", "Faculty", "Alumni", and "Employees" in the user pathways at the top of the page. Although "Community" was also a popular choice, we decided not to include that in our redesign because GSU did not already have a link for that on their website. We then chose to include "About", "Academics", "Admissions", and "Research" in the navigation bar. The other elements included in the navigation bar slightly overlapped with the links in the user pathways, but these information were more popularly included in the latter and so we chose not to include them in the navigation bar. Lastly, we chose to include "Emergency", "Disability resources", "Division and schools", and "Directory" in addition to contact and address information in the footer navigation. While the footer navigation links ranged widely from site to site, these resources were the ones most commonly used.

        <h2 class="small-heading">Specific User Pathways Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            Having figured out the elements that we wanted for all our navigation bars, we then wanted to identify which elements under each heading were most common amongst the five university sites we chose to analyze. We wanted to refrain from arbitrarily including topics that were irrelevant or unhelpful and so used our analysis of the sites to help us decide which elements were appropriate to include.

        <h2 class="small-heading">"Students" Navigation</h2>
        <!-- Students description -->
        <p>
            When we looked at the "Students" section on each university's page, we were surprised by the number of links most of the schools we looked at included on their "Students" page. Some of these links were extremely repetitive and could have been found elsewhere on the site. Other links shared the same name as links on other parts of the site, but the two links led to completely different pages, such as the "Academics" link. Furthermore, many links didn't seem to belong on the page, yet were included anyway. NYU included a "Prospective students" link which seemed to make more sense to include under "Admissions". We wanted to prevent confusion when navigating through the page, so we decided to keep the links to the bare minimum based on necessity. Due to this, we included "Academics", "Campus Life", "GoSOLAR", "PAWS", and "Desire2Learn" under our "Students" section. Under "Academics", we would include "Advising". "Academics" and "Campus Life" were the two links that were most popularly used by the websites we chose to analyze. While "Admissions" was also included by more than one university, we decided that it would be irrelevant to put that under the "Students" section and instead decided to include it in its own "Admissions" tab. We chose not to include things such as "Enrollment" or the course catalog because these are already all included in GSU's "GoSOLAR". We decided to include "PAWS" and "Desire2Learn", which is an integrated learning environment much like UCSD's ted.ucsd.edu, because they are also academic resources that students would use.

        <!-- Faculty description -->
        <p>
            The "Faculty" section on many of the university websites also included "Staff". However, there seemed to be many links included in these sections, and so we decided to separate "Faculty & Staff" into two different sections, to reduce the amount of links that would be included. To determine which links were relevant to each target demographic, we compared the links that were included in the combined "Faculty & Staff" and the separated ones. There were many links that were included on the majority of the websites, such as "Administration", "Facilities & Services", and "Research". Several of the universities included a link related to "Teaching", such as "Teaching and Learning Resources" and "Course preparation and management". Some of the links included seemed misplaced and could have been included on other parts of the site, such as "Safety". "Resources" and "Funding" were also used by more than one university, but we decided that these links could be included under other headings. Ultimately, we decided to include "Administration", "Facilities & Services", "Research", and "Training". We also wanted to include "Resources" under "Facilities & Services" and "Funding" under "Research", for the sake of keeping our links to a minimum.

        <!-- Alumni description -->
        <p>
            The "Alumni" section was quite similar across all the university sites. The "Alumni" link on UCSD and UCSF lead to separate websites dedicated to alumni, but the links included in these sections remained quite the same. From the results of our tally, we recognized that "Events" Resources", "Benefits", and some type of "News", "Community" and "Services" were the most popular links. Because the universities had similarly populated "Alumni" sections, we decided we would stick to this convention and included "News", "Community", "Events", "Resources & Services", and "Benefits" in our "Alumni" section.

        <!-- Employees description -->
        <p>
            Since many of the university websites included "Employees" with the "Faculty" section, we tried to compare the links included on sites that combined or separated the two. By doing this, we were hoping to distinguish which links were aimed towards the "Faculty" and which were directed towards "Employees". There were a few links that clearly were geared towards the "Faculty", such as the "Faculty resources", "Research", and "Student class/info", which might not have been as relevant to the employees. After we finished our tally, we discovered that "Human Resources" or "Resources & Services" were very popular links, as were "Finances" and some kind of "Development". "Benefits" was used by two universities, although it was included deeper in the navigation on Brown's site. However, we thought that "Benefits" was an important component that employees would be interested in and possibly want easy access to, so we also included that in our "Employees" section. All in all, we decided on "Human Resources & Services", "Finances", "Development" and "Benefits".

        <!-- Families description -->
        <p>
            While three of the universities included "Families" in their user pathways, UCSF did not have a "Parents" section while NYU had a "Parents" section located under their "Community" section. For the universities that did have a page for families, there were many common topics amongst them. According to the tally, "Finance" was the most commonly used link, along with "Academic Resources" and a link for getting involved or receiving a newsletter. While we all agreed that "Getting Involved" was an important link to have because families would want to stay connected and understand the university as well, we discovered that GSU did not have a newsletter that they sent out to families, as some universities do. However, further Googling showed us that GSU had some other links for parents to be involved with their children, and so we included a "Getting Involved" link for that purpose. In the end, we decided to use "Finance", "Academic Resources", and "Getting Involved" in our "Families" page.

        <!-- About description -->
        <p>
            Most of the university sites had very similar links under their "About" section. Thankfully, there were not a lot of links included, and so we were able to make our selection quite easily. We noticed that many of the universities included specific topics that pertained to their university, such as "Campus timeline", "University initiatives", "Areas of excellence", and "History". After conducting our tally, we discovered that "Missions statement", some type of "Leadership", and a "Community" related topic were the ones most commonly used on the "About" page on university websites. However, we decided to include "Rankings" as well, although it received only one tally. We chose to do this because GSU devotes an entire section on their current homepage to its rankings, and we thought that it might be important to the university if they placed it on their frontpage. Therefore, we chose to use "Mission Statement", "Leadership & University Administration", "Rankings", and "GSU in the Community" in our "About" section.

        <!-- Academics description -->
        <p>
            The "Academics" section proved to be very diverse amongst the universities that we chose to look at. Many of the universities included specializations that only applied to their school. For instance, Brown included a link for "Biology and medicine" and "School of engineering". UCSF included many links that applied to students, such as "Course catalog" and "Ggeneral education requirements". We thought this was somewhat strange because these links seemed somewhat disorganized  when included in the subheadings. Nonetheless, we conducted our tally and discovered that undergraduate and graduate degrees or programs were the most commonly used links across the five universities. Academic calendars and course catalogs were also included to a lesser degree, but we felt that these two links were very useful and decided to include them in our "Academics" section as well. However, to reduce clutter and confusion, we included these resources under "Academic Resources", so as to lessen the amount of links that would be displayed. Additionally, while navigating through the other pages in an attempt to find the "Study abroad" section, we found it difficult to locate. Due to this, we decided to include "Study abroad" under our "Academics" section, as it is a topic that many students are very interested in. Although "Study abroad" was included in the "Admissions" section for NYU, we decided that it was slightly out of place, as studying abroad is more a topic of academics. In the end, we decided upon "Undergraduate Programs", "Graduate Programs", "Departments", "Undergraduate Degrees & Majors", "Graduate Degrees & Majors", and "Study Abroad".

        <!-- Admissions description -->
        <p>
            All the universities had somewhat consistent "Admissions" pages that contained the same kind of information, namely undergraduate and graduate admissions. However, only NYU separated these two groups and had separate navigation links for each. The other universities featured many navigation links, for both undergraduate and graduate students. The result was quite cluttered and overwhelming, so we also wanted to separate the two groups and create navigation links for each group. However, there were also important links that applied to both groups of students in general, and so we wanted to include those on the same level as the "Undergraduate admissions" and the "Graduate admissions". Therefore, we decided that we would include "Undergraduate Admissions", "Graduate Admissions", "Admissions Calendar", View Status", and "Campus Tours" on our "Admissions" page. Under each of the "Unergraduate admissions" and "Graduate admissions" sections, we would include links for "Freshmen", "Transfer Students", and "International Students", to reduce clutter.

        <p>
            The "Research" page of the universities contained many common links. UCSF had slightly different links but only because they have a strong focus in medical research. However, the other universities had many similar links, which was helpful to us in deciding which sections to include in our "Research" page. As usual, we used a tally to find the most commonly used links and decided on "News", "Centers & Institutes", "Resources", "Research Labs & Faculty", and "Students". This section was the most straightforward page, and so it was easy to decide which sections we wanted to include on our page.

        <h2 class="small-heading">Specific Footer Navigation</h2>
        <!-- Footer description -->
        <p>
            We didn't feel that it was necessary to conduct the same type of analysis for the specifics of each link in the footer. Across all the university pages, the links in the footer did not contain subpages listed underneath them, as the links in the user pathways and navigation bars did. The links that were included in the footer were quite straightforward and led directly to the page they were describing. There were no dropdown menus used in any of the footer links, and so there was no need for us to calculate which sections we needed to include under our general footer links.
        </p>

        <h2 class="small-heading">Summary</h2>
        <!-- Summary -->
        <p>
            We conducted our competitive analysis to help us decide how to redesign the Georgia State University website. We chose five websites to analyze and discovered a common layout used by these sites. This layout included user pathways located in a small bar at the very top of the page, a navigation bar located in an obvious place on the site, and a footer at the very bottom of the page. The user pathways contained links for certain target audiences who would be interested in using the university website. The navigation bar served to guide the users around the site. The footer varied the most amongst all the websites and contained different information per site.
        </p>
        <p>
            The links included in the user pathways, navigation bar, and footer varied across the university, so we used a tallying system to discover what links were included in each of these parts. After we decided which links to include in the user pathways, navigation bar, and footer, respectively, we used the same tallying system to identify the most commonly used links per section in the user pathways, navigation bar, and footer. We also made some judgments to include links that were not very commonly used, according to our tallies, but seemed applicable to Georgia State University, specifically.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finishing our competitive analysis, we were ready to begin our redesign of the site. Below are tables of the user pathways, navigation bar, and footer that we chose to use.
